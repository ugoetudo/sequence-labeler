# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### To Run the Project

First, install MySQL 8+. Ubuntu users, please note that you need atleast Ubuntu 20 to install MySQL 8. The following link can be used as a reference: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/installing.html
Installing MySQL Workbench is highly recommended to visualize the data using the Instrucions can be found here: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-installing.html

Second, install node, react and npm to your system.

Third, set up a user name, password and create a database on MySQL and start MYSQL. Please lookup the instructions for doing this based on your OS.

Next, make necessary changes to the user name, password, database name and port no based on your MYSQL configuration on the sequence_labeler_api codebase. Then open a terminal and enter the sequence_labeler_api directory using `cd sequence_labeler_api`.
Install all the required packages using `npm i`.
Run the express backend code using `npm start`.

Next, enter the directory of the sequence_labeler codebase using `cd sequence_labeler` and run the code using `npm start`.
This will open a page with address 'localhost:3000' on your browser. On the browser, add '/entity_recog?htid=211' after 'localhost:3000' and give 2/3 seconds.
